# iOS SwiftUI Todo List
A native iOS app built with SwiftUI for managing your tasks efficiently.

## Features
- **State Management**: Utilizes `@State`, `@StateObject`, and `@ObservedObject` for efficient UI updates.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with the Model-View-ViewModel pattern.
- **Custom Dialogs**: Interactive and reusable dialogs for user interactions.
- **Network Requests**: Supports `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` using URLSession's `data` and `upload` tasks.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Uses `async/await` for smooth and modern asynchronous operations.
- **Loading Indicators**: Dynamic loaders to enhance user experience.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures shared instances for API management.
